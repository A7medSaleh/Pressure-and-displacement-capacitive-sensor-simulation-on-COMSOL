One of the most important sensors in nanotechnology, MEMS design or control systems are the Capacitive pressure and displacement sensors. they depend on change of measured capacitance based on position change due to applied pressure.

One of the more common applications of capacitive sensors is for precision positioning. Capacitive displacement sensors can be used to measure the position of objects down to the nanometer level. This type of precise positioning is used in the semiconductor industry where silicon wafers need to be positioned for exposure. Capacitive sensors are also used to pre-focus the electron microscopes used in testing and examining the wafers.

In this model I make an accurate modeling for a parallel plate device on Comsol to study its behavior.
